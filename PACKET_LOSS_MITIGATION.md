# Packet Loss Mitigation System - Technical Documentation

## Overview

The PicoSwitchController firmware v2.3 introduces a comprehensive packet loss mitigation system to ensure reliable communication with the Nintendo Switch console while maintaining full compatibility with the official Pro Controller protocol.

## Problem Statement

Bluetooth HID communication can suffer from packet loss due to:
- Environmental interference 
- Distance from console
- Bluetooth stack congestion
- Timing issues
- Hardware limitations

Lost packets can result in:
- Missed button presses/releases
- Stuck inputs
- Delayed responses
- Inconsistent gameplay experience

## Solution Architecture

### 1. INPUT 0x3F Report Format Support

The firmware now supports both INPUT 0x30 (standard full mode) and INPUT 0x3F (simple controller interface) formats as documented in the Nintendo Switch reverse engineering notes.

**Key Features:**
- Automatic format detection and switching
- Proper button mapping according to Nintendo Switch HID specification
- Correct analog stick data encoding for Pro Controller
- D-pad/hat switch implementation following Nintendo's protocol

**Format Details (INPUT 0x3F):**
```
Byte 0:    Report ID (0x3F)
Bytes 1-2: Button status (16-bit)
Byte 3:    Hat/D-pad data (4-bit)  
Bytes 4-11: Analog stick data (Pro Controller) or filler (Joy-Con)
```

### 2. Packet Acknowledgment Tracking

**Implementation:**
- Each outgoing packet receives a unique sequence number
- Packets are stored in a circular buffer for tracking
- Acknowledgment detection (implicit - no explicit ACK from Switch)
- Automatic cleanup of old acknowledged packets

**Data Structures:**
```cpp
struct PacketInfo {
  uint32_t sequence_number;
  uint32_t timestamp_ms;
  uint8_t retry_count;
  bool acknowledged;
  uint8_t packet_data[50];
  uint8_t packet_size;
};
```

### 3. Retry Mechanism with Exponential Backoff

**Algorithm:**
- Base retry delay: 16ms (one Bluetooth frame)
- Exponential backoff: delay = base_delay << retry_count
- Maximum retries: 3 attempts
- Packet timeout: 100ms

**Benefits:**
- Prevents network congestion
- Adapts to varying network conditions
- Balances reliability with responsiveness

### 4. Duplicate Packet Detection

**Implementation:**
- Input state hashing for fast duplicate detection
- Time-based filtering (50ms window)
- Prevents input repetition from retransmissions

**Hash Function:**
```cpp
uint32_t hash = 0;
hash ^= (buttons[0] << 24) | (buttons[1] << 16) | (buttons[2] << 8);
hash ^= stick_positions;  // Simplified stick data
```

### 5. Rate Limiting and Timing

**Features:**
- Minimum packet interval: 16ms (60Hz max rate)
- Adaptive timing based on network conditions
- Prevents overwhelming the Bluetooth stack
- Maintains real-time responsiveness

## Configuration Parameters

```cpp
#define MAX_PENDING_PACKETS 16      // Maximum tracked packets
#define MAX_RETRIES 3               // Maximum retry attempts  
#define BASE_RETRY_DELAY_MS 16      // Base retry delay (1 BT frame)
#define PACKET_TIMEOUT_MS 100       // Packet timeout threshold
```

## Nintendo Switch Compatibility

### Analog Stick Data Encoding

The firmware properly encodes analog stick data according to Nintendo's specification:
- 12-bit resolution per axis (0x000 to 0xFFF)
- Centered position: 0x800
- Little-endian byte order
- Proper bit packing for efficient transmission

## API Extensions

### New Methods

```cpp
// Enable/disable 0x3F report format
void set_report_mode_3f(bool enable);

// Process reliability system (called automatically)
void process_packet_reliability();

// Send packet with reliability tracking
bool send_packet_with_reliability(uint8_t* packet, uint8_t size);

// Manual acknowledgment (for future extensions)
void acknowledge_packet(uint32_t sequence_number);
```

## Performance Impact

### Memory Usage
- Packet tracking buffer: ~800 bytes (16 packets × 50 bytes each)
- Additional variables: ~32 bytes
- Total overhead: <1KB

### CPU Usage
- Packet processing: <1ms per frame
- Hash calculation: <100μs per packet
